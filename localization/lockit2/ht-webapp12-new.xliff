        <source>HealthTap is intended to give you easy access to health information &#40;and even care&#41; on your computer or mobile device. As a HealthTap patient &#40;with a HealthTap Prime membership or other access to consulting doctors on HealthTap&#41;, you are entitled to receive medically necessary and appropriate care, and you agree not to abuse or overuse the access to doctors provided to you. Overuse includes requests for multiple opinions on single medical condition  HealthTap consults should not be used : to obtain numerous opinions on a single medical condition. In general, doctors may discourage this practice and may be hesitant to provide an assessment to those patients who attempt to seek multiple consults. In cases where there is an absolute medical necessity, it may be appropriate to do more than one consult in a day about a specific health issue, but you may also need to consider seeking in-person care or emergency services if the level of severity truly is at the point where multiple consults are warranted &#40;especially if in-person care is recommended by a consulting doctor on HealthTap&#41;.</source>

        <source>HealthTap&apos;s Terms of Use require the use of arbitration to resolve disputes and also limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute. Most concerns can be resolved quickly by contacting our support department at support@healthtap.com. In the unlikely event that our support team is unable to resolve a legitimate legal complaint you may have &#40;or if HealthTap has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally&#41;, we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. We request that you work with us to resolve any disputes for 30 days after notifying us of such issues before filing arbitration.</source>

        <source>The AAA rules will govern the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees, unless our Arbitration Agreement expressly provides otherwise.

If the amount of the claim exceeds US$10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, HealthTap will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.

        <source>A new, independent resource for doctors and patients alike, RateRx presents ratings of medication effectiveness as reported by thousands of U.S.-licensed doctors in clinical practice in more than 137 specialties. RateRx is the first national survey of U.S.-licensed doctors, soliciting independent feedback from physicians across the country about their real-world clinical experience treating a broad range of common conditions, and rating the medications used in those treatments. RateRx represents the first comprehensive assessment of what experienced clinicians in each specialty actually use in the care of patients with specific conditions. Unlike other studies, which may report on the clinical effectiveness of treatments under controlled circumstances, RateRx calls on the deep, long-term, real-world experience of top doctors to reveal which treatments doctors have learned actually work with patients.</source>

        <source>Doctors were asked to rate the clinical effectiveness of a drug for treating a condition on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. Based on their knowledge from clinical experience using the drug for that indication, contributing doctors were instructed to rate medications for their use with specific indications. The combined ratings for each treatment have been summarized into an aggregate rating that reflects doctors’ collective experiences. The profiles of all doctors who provided ratings are publicly visible, and anyone can review details of the doctors’ training and experiences, including their specialties and board certifications.</source>

        <source>Following up your consult with a checklist is an important way to help your patient take action towards better health. Research shows that fewer than 50 percent of patients actually follow the instructions given to them in their doctors&apos; offices. We&apos;re striving to change that statistic. Compose a checklist of steps that your patient can follow after the consult is over. You can recommend both one-time and recurring actions.

        <source>HealthTap is a virtual healthcare platform that provides more than telemedicine. Other companies only offer telemedicine solutions and don’t have the doctor network or specific products and features to drive real long-term results and engagement—but HealthTap does!

Doctors on HealthTap can prescribe medication, order and review lab tests and much more. In addition, your clients also get access to the largest doctor created and curated repository of health information that is surfaced based on their health interests. Your clients can also set health goals and get timely reminders &#40;email or push&#41; from doctor created actionable checklists.

        <source>Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal power to enter into this Agreement. This Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the parties. This Agreement is the entire agreement between Subject and HealthTap relating to its subject matter, and replaces any prior agreements concerning its subject matter. If there is any conflict between this agreement and a mutually signed written agreement between HealthTap and Subscriber related to HealthTap, the signed written agreement will control.  If HealthTap provides a translation of the English language version of this agreement, the English language version of this agreement will control if there is any conflict.  If HealthTap chooses not to enforce any provision of this Agreement, HealthTap retains the right to enforce it in the future. This means that the failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of that provision. If any provision in this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, it and any related provisions will be interpreted to best accomplish the essential purpose of any unenforceable provision. Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party &#40;not to be unreasonably withheld&#41;; provided, however, HealthTap may assign this Agreement without consent of Subscriber, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Any attempt by a party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this section shall be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit successors and permitted assigns. This agreement is governed by California law, excluding California&apos;s choice-of-law rules. THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE FOR ANY DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IS SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. YOU AND US CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF THESE COURTS. Nothing in this agreement limits either party&apos;s ability to seek equitable relief. All notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given upon: &#40;i&#41; personal delivery; &#40;ii&#41; the second business day after mailing; &#40;iii&#41; the second business day after sending by confirmed facsimile; or &#40;iv&#41; if by HealthTap to Subscriber, the second business day after sending by email.

        <source>You, a physician applying to or currently providing virtual consults on HealthTap or any physician on whose behalf this Agreement is entered into &#40;“Provider”&#41;, agree to designate HealthTap to purchase and maintain malpractice insurance with a minimum annual coverage of one million dollars per incident and three million dollars in aggregate, or HealthTap’s subsequent liability minimums, to cover any acts of malpractice committed during the performance of virtual consults on HealthTap, subject to any limitations specified herein or in the policy &#40;“Insurance”&#41;.  Generally, the Insurance provides claims-made coverage for medical malpractice claims brought in the U.S., including U.S. claims made by claimants in other countries.  The coverage excludes consults or interactions outside of the HealthTap platform, claims brought outside of the U.S., and is not available to Providers with no other means of participating in a Patient Compensation Fund &#40;“PCF”&#41; program if the Provider practices in a state where PCF participation is required.  The Insurance is secondary to any other applicable or available insurance policy.  Provider agrees to provide to HealthTap or the Insurance carrier, upon request, information related to your medical practice, licensure, or events or circumstances likely to impact coverage eligibility.  This agreement is in addition to any other agreements governing use of the HealthTap platform, and any representations and warranties therein.  In the event of a claim covered or potentially covered by the Insurance and related to services provided under this Agreement and on or through a HealthTap platform &#40;including the HealthTap website and mobile apps&#41;, Provider agrees to comply with the terms required by the Insurance to receive the benefit of coverage and to: &#40;i&#41; cooperate with the investigation, settlement of defense of any claim&#40;s&#41;; &#40;ii&#41; immediately send HealthTap copies of any demands, notices, summons or legal papers received in connection with a claim; &#40;iii&#41; notify any other insurer whose coverage is or may be available; &#40;iv&#41; cooperate with the insurer with respect to coordinating any other available or potentially available insurance; &#40;v&#41; provide the insurer with written authorization to &#40;a&#41; obtain records and other information related to the claim, and &#40;b&#41; conduct and control the defense of the Physician in such claim.  By opting into this program, Provider agrees that HealthTap may withhold an additional administrative fee for the provision of this service from any payments to Provider.  Currently this fee is one dollar &#40;$1&#41; per consult, on top of any other fees applicable to the performance of consults through the HealthTap platform.  Provider may opt out of this coverage at any time, but waiting periods may apply to any future request to participate in this program.  HealthTap retains the rights to end this program or to end Provider’s participation in this program at any time and for any reason, and shall provide Provider with written notice of any such termination, in which case coverage shall apply to virtual consults up to the date of such termination.</source>

      <trans-unit id="12659" resname="RateRx is a new, independent resource for doctors and patients alike, that presents ratings of medication effectiveness as reported by thousands of U.S.-licensed doctors in clinical practice of more than 137 specialties. RateRx represents the first comprehensive assessment of what experienced clinicians in each specialty actually use in the care of patients with specific conditions. Unlike other studies, which may report on the clinical effectiveness of treatments under controlled circumstances, RateRx calls on the deep, long-term, real-world experience of top doctors to reveal which treatments doctors have learned actually work with patients. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      Doctors were asked to rate the clinical effectiveness of a drug for treating a condition on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. Contributing doctors gave ratings to medications for their use with specific indications based on their knowledge and were instructed to provide input based only on clinical experience using the drug for that indication. We summarized the combined ratings for each treatment into an aggregate rating reflecting doctors’ collective experiences. The profiles of all doctors who provided ratings are visible to users, who can review details of the doctors’ training and experiences, including their specialties and board certifications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      Participation in this study was open to all U.S.-licensed doctors in good standing. All 66,000 doctors in HealthTap’s Medical Expert Network were encouraged to participate. In addition, HealthTap invited more than 500,000 U.S. licensed doctors in our extended network to participate. Doctors are able to enter effectiveness ratings for medications that treat any condition, and can enter and add ratings for any new medication treatments not already included. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      RateRx results display each treatment for an indication in an ordered rank based on average ratings, from highest rated to lowest.  When differences between the ratings of alternative treatments are deemed meaningful based on the amount of data presented.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

      To ensure unbiased doctor evaluations, doctors do not see their colleagues’ existing contributions until after they have entered their own rating. Recommendations cannot be changed once submitted, but after ratings are submitted, doctors can view the ratings of other doctors and comment on these. Both patients and doctors can learn from the RateRx ratings system.   Patients benefit from the collective wisdom shared by these doctors, enabling them to see how different treatments for the same conditions are rated and reviewed. Doctors benefit from their colleagues’ ratings and comments, and are able to interpret them by referring to the contributing doctors’ practice profiles &#40;which show their education and experience, their specialty training, years in practice, DocScore, and their “Known for” topics&#41;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
      Comments, which are optional, are often used by doctors to qualify or explain ratings, or to share details of how medications are used for each indication. Comments are available to read and review, do not change the numeric value of the rating. Ratings are based on generic drug names, but brand names are presented to permit doctors to rate specific drugs. Brand names are shown for every generic medication name presented. This study does not differentiate ratings between different brand names for the same medication. The most common medication treatments for each condition are listed for ratings, but doctors are encouraged to add treatments for any indication, ensuring the inclusion of new or novel treatments for each condition. Doctors were instructed to add medications not previously  on the list of standard treatment only if they had experience using the medication to treat the condition at issue and found these medication effective in the treatment of that condition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Contributing doctors gave ratings to medications for their use with specific indications based on their knowledge and were instructed to provide input based only on clinical experience using the drug for that indication. We summarized the combined ratings for each treatment into an aggregate rating reflecting doctors’ collective experiences. The profiles of all doctors who provided ratings are visible to users, who can review details of the doctors’ training and experiences, including their specialties and board certifications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      Participation in this study was open to all U.S.-licensed doctors in good standing. All 66,000 doctors in HealthTap’s Medical Expert Network were encouraged to participate. In addition, HealthTap invited more than 500,000 U.S. licensed doctors in our extended network to participate. Doctors are able to enter effectiveness ratings for medications that treat any condition, and can enter and add ratings for any new medication treatments not already included. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      RateRx results display each treatment for an indication in an ordered rank based on average ratings, from highest rated to lowest.  When differences between the ratings of alternative treatments are deemed meaningful based on the amount of data presented.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

      To ensure unbiased doctor evaluations, doctors do not see their colleagues’ existing contributions until after they have entered their own rating. Recommendations cannot be changed once submitted, but after ratings are submitted, doctors can view the ratings of other doctors and comment on these. Both patients and doctors can learn from the RateRx ratings system.   Patients benefit from the collective wisdom shared by these doctors, enabling them to see how different treatments for the same conditions are rated and reviewed. Doctors benefit from their colleagues’ ratings and comments, and are able to interpret them by referring to the contributing doctors’ practice profiles &#40;which show their education and experience, their specialty training, years in practice, DocScore, and their “Known for” topics&#41;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
      Comments, which are optional, are often used by doctors to qualify or explain ratings, or to share details of how medications are used for each indication. Comments are available to read and review, do not change the numeric value of the rating. Ratings are based on generic drug names, but brand names are presented to permit doctors to rate specific drugs. Brand names are shown for every generic medication name presented. This study does not differentiate ratings between different brand names for the same medication. The most common medication treatments for each condition are listed for ratings, but doctors are encouraged to add treatments for any indication, ensuring the inclusion of new or novel treatments for each condition. Doctors were instructed to add medications not previously  on the list of standard treatment only if they had experience using the medication to treat the condition at issue and found these medication effective in the treatment of that condition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
