 * @class Represents a resource from a resource file or

 * of the following properties:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>project {String} - the project that this resource is in
 * <li><i>context</i> {String} - The context for this resource,
 * such as "landscape mode", or "7200dp", which differentiates it
 * from the base resource that has no special context. The default
 * if this property is not specified is undefined, meaning no
 * context.
 * <li>locale {String} - the locale of the source string.
 * <li>key {String} - the unique key of this string, which should include the context
 * of the string
 * <li>pathName {String} - pathName to the file where the string was extracted from
 * <li>autoKey {boolean} - true if the key was generated based on the source text
 * <li>state {String} - current state of the resource (ie. "new", "translated", or "accepted")
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @constructor
 * @param {Object} props properties of the string, as defined above
